### My first milestone project

This is my milestone project which is a web page for a cottage in the Yorkshire dales. 
The original website is here http://holidayhouseyorkshire.com/. I felt I could do a better job of it. It was both a way to practise and to learn about 
the tech out there to help build websites, as well as building a functional page. While not intended for comercial use. 
It might be used as a stepping stone to similar projects.

####UX

My idea was to make it familiar to visitors in that it is not too far from an Air BNB page. Yet I have put my own design into it. 
The page is designed to allow people to book easily while also selling the cottage, the town and the surrounding areas.
